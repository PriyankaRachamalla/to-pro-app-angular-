  <div>
    <p>After the completion of any building works it is vital that a property is left in pristine condition. As 2 pro cleaning services we can usually be on site within 24-48 hours to carry out a full Builders Clean. After Builders Cleans are time sensitive which requires the cleaning company to be flexible to the client needs.</p>
    <p>As all our cleaners are fully trained to the highest standard, you can feel confident that you have employed a professional cleaning company with all relevant qualification. There is different terminology to describe Builders Cleaning e.g. After Builders Clean, Post Renovation Cleaning, Contract Construction clean-up. At EP Cleaners we use the latest and best industrial strength cleaning chemicals and equipment operated by highly trained technicians to turn any refurbishment into a dirt-free, spotless and sparkling environment for you to live in.</p>
